JSDB - javascript debugger

This is a very simple debugging tool I created to facilitate debugging what is
going on any webpage after its been loaded on any browser that supports 
websockets and workers. This debugger consists of adding the script inclusion
to the page you want to be able to inspect on and having executed the JSDB 
debugger console before you load the page you're debugging.

This is as mentioned a very simple implementation and a lot of features can be
added but for now it serves a very simple quick and dirty way of debugging 
browsers that don't have debugging consoles (ie android, ios).
